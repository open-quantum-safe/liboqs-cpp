# Version 0.12.0 - 14 January, 2024

- Fixes https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/issues/21. The API that
  NIST has introduced in [FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)
  for ML-DSA includes a context string of length >= 0. Added new API for
  signing with a context string:
  - `bytes Signature::sign_with_ctx_str(const bytes& message,
const bytes& context) const`
  - `bool Signature::verify_with_ctx_str(const bytes& message,
const bytes& signature, const bytes& context, const bytes& public_key) const`

# Version 0.10.0 - March 27, 2024

- Replaced CHANGES by
  [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/blob/main/CHANGES.md),
  as we now use Markdown format to keep track of changes in new releases
- Removed GoogleTest dependency; if not detected, it is installed automatically
  as build dependency by CMake
- Bumped GoogleTest version to HEAD latest, as
  [recommended by Google](https://github.com/google/googletest?tab=readme-ov-file#live-at-head)
- Removed the NIST PRNG as the latter is no longer exposed by liboqs' public
  API

# Version 0.7.1 - January 5, 2022

- Release numbering updated to match liboqs
- Integrated the unit tests with the main project, so now the unit tests are
  automatically compiled along with the examples, and can now be run by typing
  `make test` or `ctest`. Use `GTEST_COLOR=1 ARGS="-V" make test` or
  `GTEST_COLOR=1 ctest -V` for coloured verbose testing output.
- CMake minimum required version bumped to 3.10 (3.12 for macOS) for automatic
  unit tests detection by CMake
- Switched continuous integration from Travis CI to CircleCI, we now support
  macOS & Linux (CircleCI) and Windows (AppVeyor)
