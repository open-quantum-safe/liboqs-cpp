## About

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and
prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography. More information on OQS can be
found on our website https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on GitHub at
https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic
algorithms. See more about liboqs at
[https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/),
including a list of supported algorithms.

**liboqs-cpp** is an open source C++ wrapper for the liboqs C library for
quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. Details about liboqs-cpp can be
found in
[README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/blob/main/README.md).
See in particular limitations on intended use.
