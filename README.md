---

**liboqs-cpp** offers a C++ wrapper for
the [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/)
C library, which is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

The wrapper is written in standard C++11, hence in the following it is assumed
that you have access to a C++11 compliant complier. liboqs-cpp has been
extensively tested on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. Continuous integration
is provided via GitHub actions.

## Pre-requisites

liboqs-cpp depends on the [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)
C library; liboqs must first be compiled as a Linux/macOS/Windows library (i.e.
using `ninja install` with `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` during configuration), see
the specific platform building instructions below.

Contents
--------

liboqs-cpp is a header-only wrapper. The project contains the following files
and directories:

- **`include/oqs_cpp.h`: main header file for the wrapper**
- `include/rand/rand.h`: support for RNGs from `<oqs/rand.h>`
- `examples/kem.cpp`: key encapsulation example
- `examples/rand.cpp`: RNG example
- `examples/sig.cpp`: signature example
- `unit_tests`: unit tests written using Google Test (included)

Usage
-----

To avoid namespace pollution, liboqs-cpp includes all of its code inside the
namespace `oqs`. All of the liboqs C API is located in the namespace `oqs::C`,
hence to use directly a C API function you must qualify the call
with `oqs::C::liboqs_C_function(...)`.

liboqs-cpp defines four main classes: `oqs::KeyEncapsulation`
and `oqs::Signature`, providing post-quantum key encapsulation and signture
mechanisms, respectively, and
`oqs::KEMs` and `oqs::Sigs`, containing only static member functions that
provide information related to the available key encapsulation mechanisms or
signature mechanism, respectively.

`oqs::KeyEncapsulation` and/or `oqs::Signature` must be instantiated with a
string identifying one of mechanisms supported by liboqs; these can be
enumerated using the `oqs::KEMs::get_enabled_KEM_mechanisms()`
and `oqs::Sigs::get_enabled_sig_mechanisms()` member functions.

Support for alternative RNGs is provided by the `include/rand/rand.h` header
file, which exports its functions in `namespace oqs::rand`. This header file
must be explicitly included in order to activate the support for alternative
RNGs.

The wrapper also defines a high resolution timing class, `oqs::Timer<>`.

The examples in
the [`examples`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/tree/main/examples)
directory are self-explanatory and provide more details about the wrapper's API.

Building on POSIX (Linux/UNIX-like) platforms
---------------------------------------------

First, you must build liboqs according to
the [liboqs building instructions](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs#linuxmacos)
with shared library support enabled (add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to the `cmake`
command), followed (optionally) by a `sudo ninja install` to ensure that the
shared library is visible system-wide (by default it installs
under `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib` on Linux/macOS).

You may need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS)
environment variable to point to the path to liboqs' library directory, e.g.

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

assuming `liboqs.so.*` were installed in `/usr/local/lib` (true if you
ran `sudo ninja install` after building liboqs).

Next, to use the wrapper, you simply `#include "oqs_cpp.h"` in your program. The
wrapper contains a CMake build system for both examples and unit tests. To
compile and run the examples, execute from the project's root directory

```bash
cmake -B build -DLIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include -DLIBOQS_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib
cmake --build build --parallel 4
```

The above commands build all examples in `examples`, together with the unit
tests suite, assuming the CMake build system is available on your platform.
The `-DLIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR` and `-DLIBOQS_LIB_DIR` flags specify the location to
the liboqs headers and compiled library, respectively. You may omit those flags
in case you installed liboqs in `/usr/local` (true if you
ran `sudo ninja install` after building liboqs). You may replace
the `--parallel 4` flag with your processor's number of cores, e.g.
use `--parallel 8` if your system has 8 cores. To build only a specific example,
e.g. `examples/kem`, specify the target as the argument of the `cmake` command,
such as

```bash
cmake --build build --target kem
```

To run the unit tests, execute from the root's project

```bash
	ctest --test-dir build
```

after building the project. Use `GTEST_COLOR=1 ctest -V --test-dir build` for
coloured verbose testing output.

Building on Windows
-------------------

Ensure that the liboqs shared library `oqs.dll` is visible system-wide. Use
the "Edit the system environment variables" Control Panel tool or type in a
Command Prompt

	set PATH="%PATH%;C:\some\dir\liboqs\build\bin"

of course replacing the paths with the ones corresponding to your system.

Then follow the same building instructions as for POSIX systems.

Documentation
-------------
To generate the full official API documentation in both PDF and HTML formats run
[`doxygen`](http://www.doxygen.nl) on
the [`Doxyfile`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/blob/main/Doxyfile)
file. The tool `dot` from the [`Graphviz`](https://www.graphviz.org) package
must be installed (`sudo apt-get install graphviz` in Ubuntu/Debian).
Running `doxygen` will generate the documentation directory `doc` containing
both the HTML and LaTeX documentation.

The HTML documentation file will be accessible by opening `doc/html/index.html`
with the browser of your choice.

To generate a PDF file of the documentation, run

```bash
latexmk -pdf refman.tex
```

from the `doc/latex` directory or compile the file `doc/latex/refman.tex` with
your LaTeX compiler. This will create the `doc/latex/refman.pdf` documentation
file. Consult your favourite LaTeX manual for how to compile/build LaTeX files
under your specific operating system.

Limitations and security
------------------------

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant
cryptography. Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly
change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against
either classical or quantum computers.

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is
currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant
algorithms. liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend
that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization
project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum
cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project. We
strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid
cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside
traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the
solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.
