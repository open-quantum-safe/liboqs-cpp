## About

**liboqs-cpp** offers a C++ wrapper for
the [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/)
C library, which is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

The wrapper is written in standard C++11, hence in the following it is assumed
that you have access to a C++11 compliant compiler. liboqs-cpp has been
extensively tested on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. Continuous integration
is provided via GitHub actions.

liboqs-cpp is a header-only wrapper. The project contains the following files
and directories:

- **`include/oqs_cpp.h`: main header file for the wrapper**
- `include/rand/rand.h`: support for RNGs from `<oqs/rand.h>`
- `examples/kem.cpp`: key encapsulation example
- `examples/rand.cpp`: RNG example
- `examples/sig.cpp`: signature example
- `unit_tests`: unit tests written using Google Test (included)

## Pre-requisites

- [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- C++11 compliant compiler, e.g., [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  , [clang](https://clang.llvm.org)
  , [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) etc.

## Installation

### Configure, build and install liboqs

Execute in a Terminal/Console/Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs
cmake -S liboqs -B liboqs/build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
cmake --build liboqs/build --parallel 8
cmake --build liboqs/build --target install
```

The last line may require prefixing it by `sudo` on UNIX-like systems.
Change `--parallel 8` to match the number of available cores on your system.

On UNIX-like platforms, you may need to set
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS) environment variable to
point to the path to liboqs' library directory, e.g.,

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
```

On Windows platforms, **you must ensure** that the liboqs shared
library `oqs.dll` is visible system-wide, and that the following environment
variable are being set. Use the "Edit the system environment variables" Control
Panel tool or execute in a Command Prompt, e.g.,

```shell
set PATH="%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\liboqs\bin"
```

You can change liboqs' installation directory by configuring the build to use an
alternative path, e.g., `C:\liboqs`, by replacing the first CMake line above by

```shell
cmake -S liboqs -B liboqs/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\liboqs" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

### Configure and build the wrapper

Execute in a Terminal/Console/Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp
cmake -S liboqs-cpp -B liboqs-cpp/build
```

followed, on UNIX-like platforms, by

```shell
cmake --build liboqs-cpp/build --parallel 8
```

and, on Windows platforms, by

```shell
cmake --build liboqs-cpp/build -DLIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\Program Files (x86)\liboqs\include" -DLIBOQS_LIB_DIR="C:\Program Files (x86)\liboqs\lib" --parallel 8
```

Note that you may need to change the flags `-DLIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR`
and `-DLIBOQS_LIB_DIR` to point to the correct location of `liboqs` in case you
installed it in a non-standard location.

To build only a specific target, e.g. `examples/kem`, specify the target as the
argument of the `cmake` command, e.g.,

```shell
cmake --build liboqs-cpp/build --target kem
```

### Run the unit tests

```shell
ctest --test-dir liboqs-cpp/build
```

### Run the examples

```shell
./liboqs-cpp/build/kem
./liboqs-cpp/build/sig
./liboqs-cpp/build/rand
```

Note that on Windows platforms, the location of the built examples may be
slightly different, e.g., `./liboqs-cpp/build/Debug/kem`.

## Usage

liboqs-cpp is a header-only wrapper. The project contains the following files
and directories:

- **`include/oqs_cpp.hpp`: main header file for the wrapper**
- `include/common.hpp`: utility code
- `include/rand/rand.hpp`: support for RNGs from `<oqs/rand.h>`
- `examples/kem.cpp`: key encapsulation example
- `examples/rand.cpp`: RNG example
- `examples/sig.cpp`: signature example
- `unit_tests`: unit tests written using Google Test (included)

To avoid namespace pollution, liboqs-cpp includes all of its code inside the
namespace `oqs`. All the liboqs C API is located in the namespace `oqs::C`,
hence to use directly a C API function you must qualify the call
with `oqs::C::liboqs_C_function(...)`.

liboqs-cpp defines four main classes: `oqs::KeyEncapsulation`
and `oqs::Signature`, providing post-quantum key encapsulation and signture
mechanisms, respectively, and
`oqs::KEMs` and `oqs::Sigs`, containing only static member functions that
provide information related to the available key encapsulation mechanisms or
signature mechanism, respectively.

`oqs::KeyEncapsulation` and/or `oqs::Signature` must be instantiated with a
string identifying one of mechanisms supported by liboqs; these can be
enumerated using the `oqs::KEMs::get_enabled_KEM_mechanisms()`
and `oqs::Sigs::get_enabled_sig_mechanisms()` member functions.

Support for alternative RNGs is provided by the `include/rand/rand.h` header
file, which exports its functions in `namespace oqs::rand`. This header file
must be explicitly included in order to activate the support for alternative
RNGs.

The wrapper also defines a high resolution timing class, `oqs::Timer<>`.

The examples in
the [`examples`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/tree/main/examples)
directory are self-explanatory and provide more details about the wrapper's API.

## Documentation

To generate the full official API documentation in both PDF and HTML formats run
[`doxygen`](http://www.doxygen.nl) on
the [`Doxyfile`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/blob/main/Doxyfile)
file. The tool `dot` from the [`Graphviz`](https://www.graphviz.org) package
must be installed (`sudo apt-get install graphviz` in Ubuntu/Debian).
Running `doxygen` will generate the documentation directory `doc` containing
both the HTML and LaTeX documentation.

The HTML documentation file will be accessible by opening `doc/html/index.html`
with the browser of your choice.

To generate a PDF file of the documentation, run

```shell
latexmk -pdf refman.tex
```

from the `doc/latex` directory or compile the file `doc/latex/refman.tex` with
your LaTeX compiler. This will create the `doc/latex/refman.pdf` documentation
file. Consult your favourite LaTeX manual for how to compile/build LaTeX files
under your specific operating system.

## Limitations and security

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant
cryptography. Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly
change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against
either classical or quantum computers.

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is
currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant
algorithms. liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend
that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization
project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum
cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project. We
strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid
cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside
traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the
solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.

Just like liboqs, liboqs-cpp is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.
