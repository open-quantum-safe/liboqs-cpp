Version 0.7.1 - January 5, 2022
    - Release numbering updated to match liboqs
    - Integrated the unit tests with the main project, so now the unit tests
      are automatically compiled along with the examples, and can now be run
      by typing 'make test' or 'ctest'. Use 'GTEST_COLOR=1 ARGS="-V" make test'
      or 'GTEST_COLOR=1 ctest -V' for coloured verbose testing output.
    - CMake minimum required version bumped to 3.10 (3.12 for macOS) for
      automatic unit tests detection by CMake
    - Switched continuous integration from Travis CI to CircleCI, we now
      support macOS & Linux (CircleCI) and Windows (AppVeyor)
